## About the Project

Artificial Intelligence misuse is no longer a future risk in India — it is an ongoing reality. This project documents and analyses state-wise incidents of AI-related harm including deepfakes, financial fraud, voice cloning scams, electoral manipulation, and algorithm-amplified communal conflict.

The database covers **28 Indian states** across a **2021–2025** timeline and categorises incidents into 6 primary harm types. It also documents governance responses at both the state and central government level.
