  date: "May 28, 2025",
  summary: `Around 200 people in Karnataka were cheated through an app called “Trump Hotel Rental”.
App shows the AI-generated videos of Donald Trump in order to gain trust. People were told that if they rented virtual 
hotel rooms, they would earn high profits.
Initially, the app allowed users to withdraw small amounts like Rs.300 to gain their trust. People were encouraged

After 5–6 months, the app stopped working. Users could not withdraw money and the scammers disappeared.
Total loss was around Rs.2 crore. This is a major example of AI deepfake-driven fraud.`,

      summary: `A deepfake video of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, edited to show him lamenting defeat and a lack of support from China and the UAE, went viral across Indian social media during Operation Sindoor.
The original video actually showed Sharif commending Pakistan's Air Force response. AI voice cloning and lip-sync technology were used to fabricate an entirely different speech.
Fact-checkers at BOOM, Alt News, and IFJ debunked the clip. It was shared over 700,000 times before being widely debunked — illustrating how AI disinformation can outpace verification in wartime.`,

The original video was an ANI interview where General Malik actually said India has "better weapons and equipment" than Pakistan.
Newschecker used Google Lens to trace the original. General Malik himself called it out publicly: "It is a deepfake. Pakistani ISI at work!"
Security analysts noted such disinformation campaigns intensified after Operation Sindoor, targeting senior defence officials to undermine military morale.`,
